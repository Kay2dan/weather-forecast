## NOTICE 
	Please note, if you review the code on Github, you will notice the formating off a bit, which is due to Github not very friendly to tabs indentation.

## FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO ADD
	As requested, here are things I would do if I had more than the four hours allocated to this task (I did go a bit over the limit).

	1. Correct formatting/ styling of webpage, using flexbox. I would like to have it as an SPA (single page app).
	2. Tests, I would use 'Jest' to write tests as per the best practice nowadays. I feel 100% coverage is not always necessary so atleast cover the main areas with tests would be most helpful.
	3. Ideally, I would use one or more 'higher-order' components to take the computations away from the react components, just nicely / more readable code.
	4. Icons, I saw these icons and intended to add them, as you may notice from the file-loader I installed in webpack.config file. However, I barely had time for css, let alone adding these icons.

	5. Slight animations would bring life to the page, I would use animate.css for this basic task.

## FINAL
	I would like to continue work on this & incorporate all the features discussed above.

	Thanks for this opportunity.
